# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shruti Singh (@Shruti-Singh2106)

ðŸŽ¯ Hello! Iâ€™m Shruti from New Delhi, India. A naturally inquisitive data enthusiast with an economics background and a passion for personal knowledge management, collecting economic data, and uncovering insights that foster new ideas. My journey into the world of data began during my economics studies, where I developed an inherent love for capturing, organizing, distilling, and expressing informationâ€”especially for analyzing trends, forecasting, and understanding consumer behaviors. This fascination drove me to master SQL, spreadsheets, Power Bi, turning raw data into compelling stories, and linking economic theory to real-world impact. With a robust foundation in economic analysis and data interpretation, Iâ€™ve honed my analytical skills to drive strategic decisions and uncover growth opportunities.
